Create a C# Windows Application (Console, WinForms or WPF) to manage an Employee Directory. The program should support Inserting, Updating and Deleting Employee Records. It should also display the current list of Employees back to the User. The Program should trigger events that occur on Insert, Update and Delete of an Employee and display a message to the User notifying them of the action performed. An Employee record consists of a Name and Job Title. The data does not need to persist after the program exits, but doing so would be an added bonus. 
Feel free to use any design patterns you are familiar with and exercise creative freedom in the look/feel of the Application and database technology.
